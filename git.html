        <p><li>Git is a version control system that is used to track changes to files and projects. It is commonly used by developers to collaborate on software projects, but it can also be used for any type of project that involves multiple people working on the same files.</li></p>

        <p><li>When you use Git, you can save different versions of your project, called "commits," which allow you to track changes and revert back to previous versions if needed. This is useful if you make a mistake or want to try out a new idea without losing your previous work.</li></p>

        <p><li>Git is called a "distributed" version control system, which means that it allows multiple people to work on the same project without having to rely on a central server. Each person's copy of the project is called a "repository," and they can work on their own repository and merge their changes with others when they are ready.</li></p>

        <p><li>GitHub is a website that is used to host Git repositories. It is a platform for developers to share and collaborate on software projects, and it provides a range of tools and features that make it easier to work with Git.</li></p>

        <p><li>One of the key features of GitHub is its ability to track issues and bugs in a project. Developers can use GitHub to create and track issues, and assign them to different people for resolution. This helps teams to collaborate and stay organized, and makes it easier to identify and fix problems in a project.</li></p>

        <p><li>In addition to hosting repositories and tracking issues, GitHub also provides tools for reviewing and testing code, and for managing access to repositories. It is an essential platform for many developers, and is used by millions of people around the world.</li></p>

        <p><li>Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, understanding Git and GitHub is an important skill for anyone interested in collaborating on software projects. With a little bit of practice and some basic knowledge, anyone can learn to use these powerful tools to create and maintain software projects of all kinds.</li></p>
